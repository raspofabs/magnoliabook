# Learning arduino with the Magnolia

This gitbook is a guide for beginners who have their hands on a Magnolia board from the L.A. Robotics club, originally developed as a Kickstarter campaign to produce an Arduino inspired robotics starter kit for a very meagre sum of $5 per board.

This guide is for those who already have their board, have an FTDI board, and a USB cable.

The lessons cover the very basics of Arduino, and hopefully also give good foundations in electronics that will help you search and learn more easily on your own.
