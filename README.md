# Learning arduino with the Magnolia

This gitbook is a guide for beginners who have their hands on a Magnolia board from the L.A. Robotics club, originally developed as a kickstarter campaign to produce an arduino style robotics starter kit for $5 per board.

This guide is for those who already have their board, have an FTDI board, and a USB cable.
