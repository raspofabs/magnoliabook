# Learning arduino with the Magnolia

This gitbook is a guide for beginners who have their hands on a Magnolia board from the L.A. Robotics club, originally developed as a Kickstarter campaign to produce an Arduino inspired robotics starter kit for a very meagre sum of $5 per board.

This guide is for those who already have their board, have an FTDI board, and a USB cable.

The lessons cover the very basics of Arduino, and hopefully also give good foundations in electronics that will help you search and learn more easily on your own.

Magnolia is an Open Hardware project, the schematics are available here http://www.annikaobrien.com/magnolia
